# AI-code-Debugger

An **AI-powered Python code debugger** is a tool that automatically **detects errors**, <br>  
provides **explanations**, and suggests **fixes**. It uses a combination of **static code analysis**, <br>  
**error classification**, and **AI-powered text generation (e.g., GPT-4)** to assist developers in debugging.  


## 🛠️ How It Works  

1️⃣ Upload your Python script (`.py` file) or paste your code.  
2️⃣ The debugger analyzes errors, suggests fixes, and explains solutions.  
3️⃣ Choose from CLI, Flask Web App, or Streamlit for debugging.  
4️⃣ Get step-by-step solutions with AI-powered explanations.  


## ✨ Features  
✔️ AI-powered error detection & solutions  
✔️ Supports CLI, Flask (Web App), and Streamlit  
✔️ Shows exact line numbers and fixes  
✔️ Explains errors with examples  
✔️ Lightweight and easy to use  


## 📚 Libraries Used  
🔹 `openai` – Uses GPT-4 to analyze code errors  
🔹 `flask` – Provides a web-based debugging interface  
🔹 `streamlit` – Interactive UI for debugging  
🔹 `os` – Handles file uploads and path management  
🔹 `re` – Extracts useful data from error messages  




## **🔸 6️⃣ How the Code Works (Detailed Explanation)**  
✅ Explain the debugging process and what each file does.  

📌 **Example:**  
```md
## 📝 How the Code Works  

- `main.py` → The main file that runs the menu-driven debugger.  
- `cli_debugger.py` → Handles debugging in command-line mode.  
- `web_debugger.py` → Flask-based web debugging.  
- `streamlit_ui.py` → Streamlit interface for interactive debugging.  
- `utils.py` → Contains helper functions like API calls and file handling.  

### 🔹 Debugging Process  
1️⃣ The user selects a mode (CLI, Web, Streamlit).  
2️⃣ The debugger scans the uploaded Python file.  
3️⃣ Errors are analyzed and sent to AI for explanation.  
4️⃣ The AI provides step-by-step solutions.  
5️⃣ The user can apply fixes or see alternative solutions.
